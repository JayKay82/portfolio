#My Contact/Portfolio Page

##Summary

This repo contains all the code for my upcoming portfolio site. The main features of the site will be an about page (containing my profile and cv), a basic blog, a case studies (of my work) section and a contact page. I intend to add basic authentication for just myself to login and update the blog and case studies.

### Technology

I intent to learn the MEAN stack as I am building the site. I will not use a yo generator for this but for educational purposes build the project from scratch. The site will have a responsive layout hand coded using CSS media queries. Basic interactivity will be done in jQuery.
